# Radioboard Recognizer

This is the repo for Digital Ink recognizer. This along with AndServer combine to form the backend for recognizing shapes & handwritten text over HTTP by receieving & emulating strokes from a remote endpoint eg. Teams Addon or webpages.

This works in conjunction with the app at [github.com/iakashpaul/radioboard-backend](github.com/iakashpaul/radioboard-backend) to allow multiple users to work on an intelligent whiteboard simulatneously.
